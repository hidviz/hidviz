Hidviz is a GUI application for in-depth analysis of USB HID class devices. The 2 main usecases are reverse-engineering
existing devices and developing new USB HID devices.

*USB HID class consists of many possible devices, e.g. mice, keyboards,
joysticks and gamepads. But that's not all! There are more exotic HID devices, e.g. weather stations, medical equipment
(thermometers, blood pressure monitors) or even simulation devices (think of flight sticks!).*
